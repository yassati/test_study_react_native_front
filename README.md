- Assignment :
  - You are asked to build a simple pokedex in react native and/or over web browser using this API: https://pokeapi.co/

## Main functionality

- [x] A user can browse individual pokemons
- [x] A user can add pokemons to their favorites (no need to save to db, but should be mantained in session)

## Bonus

Some nice to haves, when there is time to spare.

- [ ] A user can browse pokemons based on their type
- [ ] A user can compare base stats of two pokemons

## Complicated Bonus

Do this _only_ if you have a lot of time to spare / the challenge was way to easy, it is not only not required or expected, it is a tough one.

- [ ] A user can see the evolution chain of a pokemon
